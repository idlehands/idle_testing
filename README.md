# IdleTesting

This is the code set up for the Denver Erlang and Elixir Meetup on 04/06/2020.

The commits show the different steps, with the final being the code that was completed during the presentation.

I had stepped through most of it before hand, making commits along the way. I then deleted all of it right before the meetup and we wrote this together, with me driving most of it and then getting audience participation on the last test.
